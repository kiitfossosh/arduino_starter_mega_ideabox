a. Name of the Idea/Project: Humidity and Temperature data monitor with Arduino IoT Cloud

b. Tools/Sensors/Boards Required : 
  1. Arduino Nano 33 IoT
  2. DHT22 Humidity and temperature sensor
  
c. Description of your Project/Idea:
This will help you understand more about this platform. This project requires only a Nano 33 IoT and a DHT22 to make. The project is quite simple. It will store the data     (humidity & temperature data) under the variables and the IoT Dashboard will display the data and even gaph the data!

The properties are to be set as followed:

1. Humidity - 
Name: Humidity;
Variable: humidity;
Permission: Read only;
Update: every 3 seconds


2. Temperature - 
Name: Temperature;
Variable: temperature;
Permission: Read only;
Update: every 3 seconds

If you would like to see the graph of the data, add a graph (or chart) and link it to th erespective variables

d. Benefits of this project (what you will learn):
This project will help you transition from normal to cloud integration with Arduino and open you to many endless possibilities
